# burp-hashcat-maskprocessor

Burp Hashcat Maskprocessor Extension, inspired by hashcat maskprocessor https://github.com/hashcat/maskprocessor 

Python code credits to https://github.com/Xvezda/python-maskprocessor (https://pypi.org/project/maskprocessor/) thank you. 

I could use python ```pip install maskprocessor``` on jython and ```import maskprocessor```, but this is easier installation.

My credit goes to Burp Extension self.
